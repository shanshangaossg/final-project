The ideas for designing node and edge features in this project were inspired by: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Descriptions-of-node-and-edge-features_tbl1_339424976

Usage
1. Preprocess the Data
Prepare the raw molecular datasets by running the preprocessing script: dataset.py
2. Train the Model
Train one of the GNN models (e.g., GAT, GATv2, GCN) by running: model
